# vxLibc - v1.0.3

This is a wrapper around the
[fxlibc](https://gitea.planet-casio.com/Vhex-Kernel-Core/fxlibc) project
which is the standard system C library implementation for all Casio fx
calculators.

## Installing

You can use the `scripts/install.sh --help` to see manual installation of the
project. But, since the compiler needed to build the `vxOpenLibm` is
`sh-elf-vhex` which automatically installs this project, you theoretically do
not need to do so.

## README and Licensing

See the original
[REAME file](https://gitea.planet-casio.com/Vhex-Kernel-Core/fxlibc/src/branch/master/README.md)
of the `fxlibc` project for further information.
Note that `fxlibc` uses the `CC0 1.0 Universal License`, see
[LICENSE](https://gitea.planet-casio.com/Vhex-Kernel-Core/fxlibc/src/branch/master/LICENSE)

## Special thanks

A big thanks to
[Lephenixnoir](https://silent-tower.net/projects/) who ported most of the
standard!
